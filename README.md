<h2>Features</h2>
<h4>Home Page</h4>
<p>The Home Page displays a header with a centered logo, which serves as a link to the main page.
  The page is divided into two sections:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Meal of the Day:</b> This section presents the "Meal of the Day," displaying its name, category,
    country, and tags (if available) along with an image. The block is clickable and redirects to
    the detailed description page. The meal is randomly selected using an appropriate API endpoint.</li>
  <li><b>Search Section:</b>This section allows users to search for meals. Users can enter a search term and
    click the "Search" button or press "Enter." The app will retrieve a list of meals with matching names and
    display them in a single row. Each block contains an image, meal name,
    category, and country. Clicking on a block redirects to the detailed description page.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Meal Details Page</h4>
